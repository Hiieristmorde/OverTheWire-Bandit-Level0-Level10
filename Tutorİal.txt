 LEVEL - 0  >  1 - 

 Level Goal is the finding the password for the next level which is in the readme file. 

 Solution :  
 
 -On the console type ls 
 -Then type cat readme
 -Host will give you the password for the next level copy and then  type exit. 

 Explanation : 

 -We were already connected the host thats why we did not need to connect anything we just have to type ls to able to see files but actually 
 file name was already given to us so we wasnt have to list the files but for the next levels we will need to do it.  after seeing the file name 
 we typed cat then file name. with cat command we can read the files.

 LEVEL - 1 > 2 - 

  Level Goal is the finding password in file called "-". Host : bandit.labs.overthewire.org  Username: bandit1 Pass: 

 Solution :  
 -On the console type SSH bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
 -then server will ask for pass type the pass which is : ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If(can be different for every session I typed bc able to follow the document correctly.)
 -If you want to see the all the files type ls -la 
 -Type cat ./- 
 -Host will give you the password
 
 Explanation : 

 -The file we need to cat(read) is name with "-" but we can not read like that because of the name "-". this parameter also uses for represent in linux system. 
 For that we need to define the console this is not a parameter its a file name so we need to type "./". with this code  we defining this is a 
 File name not parameter.
